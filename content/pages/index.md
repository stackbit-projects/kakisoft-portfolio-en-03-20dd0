      ## About me


      ![](/\_static/app-assets/images/8.jpg)


      I use the name "kakisoft" on the internet.

      Please call me "kaki".


      I'm a Software Engineer. I often use Laravel, React, and AWS.

      And also I specialize in logistics because I have created many logistics
      systems.


      I am creating a new system now.

      Our new service will launch on September 1st.

      So, I have to work hard.

      ## Life

      ![](/\_static/app-assets/images/4.jpg)

      I have two sons.
      My younger son is 2 years old and my older son is 5 years old.
      They are too young, so I have to really take care of them.

      Sometimes, they disturb me during my work and online English lesson.
      But, they are really cute.

      ## Why I am learning English


      ![](/\_static/app-assets/images/1.jpg)


      English is standard language in IT industry.

      When I catch up with the latest IT technology, I have to read the
      technical document in English or watch the video in English.

      So, I started learning English seriously.


      If I speak English better, I will be able to get more jobs globally.


      And the relationship between logistics and English is very good.

      It is an advantage when I get a logistics job.
