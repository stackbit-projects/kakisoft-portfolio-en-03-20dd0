      ## About me


      ![](/\_static/app-assets/images/Australia-11.jpg)


      I use the name "kakisoft" on the internet.

      Please call me "kaki".


      I’m a software engineer. I often use Laravel, React, and AWS.


      Especially, I created many logistic systems.

      I have experience in launching and stabilization warehouse management
      systems.

      So, I’m a software engineer and also logistics specialist.

      ## Life

      ![](/\_static/app-assets/images/4.jpg)

      I have two sons.
      The younger one is 2 years old and the older one is 5 years old.
      They are very little, so I have to really take care of them.

      Sometimes, they disturb me during my work and online English lesson.
      But, they are really cute.

      ## Why I am learning English


      ![](/\_static/app-assets/images/1.jpg)


      English is standard language in IT industry.

      When I catch up with the latest IT technology, I have to read the
      technical document in English or watch the video in English.

      So, I started learning English seriously.


      If I speak English better, I will be able to get more jobs globally.


      And the relationship between logistics and English is very good.

      It is an advantage when I get a logistics job.
